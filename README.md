Is your fqdn and hostname set properly ?
========================================

Run ``bigsudo yourlabs.fqdn user@host`` to fix them.

Without variables, it will question for variables and remember
them so you can run the same command without variables again.

Without target (``user@host``), it will execute on localhost.
